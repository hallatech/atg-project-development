# atg-project-devops
An example Oracle Commerce (ATG) project lifecycle development project from a DevOps perspective

Details how you might setup an ATG development project with all the DevOps configurations for full life-cycle development and deployments.

This is based on a macOs development and Linux deployment platform. Windows should not be that much different, except for local development setup.
The steps will assume the minimal supporting software requirements and incrementally add them as the project expands.

We will target a JBoss application server and an Oracle database
